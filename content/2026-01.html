            An entertaining look at how the Decadent movement emerged in the
            middle of the 19th century. In a world where industrialization and
            urbanization were uprooting traditional family structures, and new
            scientific findings were revealing the ephemerality of the
            individual, a spiritual void was forming: what if life was
            meaningless? In response to this unsettling possibility, some
            suggested that the purpose of life was the pursuit of intense, and
            ever-escalating, moments of pleasure.

            A deeply thoughtful exploration of the ethical and emotional
            complexities of eating meat. Though the moral implications of the
            narrative are often starkly clear, the book is no sermon: it dwells
            in uncertainty and unanswered questions, such as whether some people
            may <em>need</em>, for health and other reasons, to consume at least
            some amount of meat. In the end, it may be that meat is both
            necessary <em>and</em> that it is murder, an ambiguity that many
            ancient societies—which often really did have no choice but
            to eat animals—devoted significant energy and thought to grappling
            with.
