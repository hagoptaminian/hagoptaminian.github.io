            It's 1958, and Nedra and Viri are a young couple living in suburban
            New York. They have two daughters and bohemian friends; they host
            dinner parties and go to the theater. It appears to be a happy
            enough life... but this is mid-century America, and suburban idylls
            are fracturing. Nedra, especially, yearns for more, and Viri's meek
            contentedness is bound to disappoint her. Hers is a courageously
            undertaken but ultimately impossible search, while Viri's basic
            decency and acceptance of constraints come to seem increasingly
            benighted. In the end, neither of them is prepared for what the
            passage of time does to a life.

          <div class="content-description">
            A compelling and readable book on how China's top-down "engineering
            state" pulls off feats of building that the more "lawyerly" U.S.
            increasingly struggles to match. But while acknowledging the
            strengths of China's approach, Wang also reveals its brutal costs
            when it gets things wrong, as it did with its one-child and
            zero-Covid policies. And for all the material improvement, China's
            lack of pluralism and freedom means many Chinese, especially the
            young, still long to leave the country.
