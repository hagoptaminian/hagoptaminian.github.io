            An ode to Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx, who died in June 2025.
            Evokes a bygone era of old-school, brick-and-mortar
            entrepreneurship, where businesses were built slowly, over decades,
            with minimal hype.

            On the multitudes of meaning behind the shoes we wear. Little
            noticed, they say a lot about us: Where we walk, what we do for
            work, what 'tribes' we belong to. They anchor our memories (think of
            how an old pair of shoes transports you in time) and our metaphors
            (you 'step into another man's shoes').

            A thoughtful, thought-provoking piece on human migration. I was
            surprised to learn that, despite the headlines, more than 96% of the

              "People have moved for many reasons, but always because they
              sought something they wanted that they could not get at home. It's

            An excellent piece on how good health ('salutogenesis') is not just
            an individual outcome, but one rooted in broader systems, including
            the state of the planet itself.
            <i>
              "This reversal doesn't diminish the importance of personal
              well-being, but rather resituates it. It suggests that the pursuit
              of individual health, when disconnected from the health of the
              encompassing biosphere, becomes a Sisyphean task."
            </i>
            Drawing on the work of sociologist Aaron Antonovsky, the piece also
            highlights the importance of what he calls a "sense of coherence" in
            salutogenesis.

            A piece arguing that paradigms of modernity deeply shape our social,
            cultural, and political lives. Industrial modernity inspired an era
            of top-down, hierarchical organization, and though it delivered
            prosperity in the form of rising living standards, stable jobs, and
            increasing wages, it came with tyrannies of its own, such as its
            stifling of individualism and stultifying uniformity. Celebrating
            individualism and decentralization, today's dominant paradigm,
            <i>digital</i> modernity, promises liberation from precisely those
            tyrannies. But it comes with its own tyrannies: the dominant digital
            platforms and their algorithms nudge us this way and that, shaping
            our social reality. Perhaps most perniciously, they undermine our
            capacity for ambitious collective projects and decision-making.

            David Runciman in conversation with Alexander Douglass, author of
            the recently published
            <cite>Against Identity: The Wisdom of Escaping the Self</cite>. Deep
            and nuanced, the discussion reveals how the ways in which we
            determine our identities have changed over the past several
            centuries. Where most of us were once born into pre-existing roles,
            and our task was largely to perform them, today many of us are
            expected to have an 'authentic', self-articulating identity‚Äîwhich we
            paradoxically construct, Douglass suggests, by emulating others.
