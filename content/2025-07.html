            An ode to Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx, who died in June 2025.
            Evokes a bygone era of old-school, brick-and-mortar
            entrepreneurship, where businesses were built slowly, over decades,
            with minimal hype.

            On the multitudes of meaning behind the shoes we wear. Little
            noticed, they say a lot about us: Where we walk, what we do for
            work, what 'tribes' we belong to. They anchor our memories (think of
            how an old pair of shoes transports you in time) and our metaphors
            (you 'step into another man's shoes').

            A thoughtful, thought-provoking piece on human migration. I was
            surprised to learn that, despite the headlines, more than 96% of the
            world's population lives in the country it was born in. "People have
            moved for many reasons, but always because they sought something
            they wanted that they could not get at home. It's an act of faith,
            fundamentally, kindled by the fire of human aspiration."

            An excellent piece on how good health ('salutogenesis') is not just
            an individual outcome but one rooted in the community and broader
            planet. Its components include a perception that the world is, if
            not stable, then predictable; that you can make plans with
            reasonable reliability; that you have the resources to adapt or cope
            with challenges; and that the world broadly makes sense.

            A piece arguing that paradigms of modernity shape social, cultural,
            and political life. Industrial modernity inspired an era of
            top-down, hierarchical organization, and though it delivered
            prosperity in the form of rising living standards, stable jobs, and
            increasing wages, it came with tyrannies of its own, such as its
            stifling of individualism and stultifying uniformity. Today's
            dominant paradigm, <i>digital</i> modernity, promises liberation
            from precisely those tyrannies: it celebrates individualism and
            decentralization. But it comes with tyrannies of its own: the
            dominant platforms and their algorithms nudge us this way and that,
            shaping our social reality. Perhaps most perniciously, they
            undermine our capacity for ambitious collective projects and
            decision-making.

            Writer and journalist Lisa Goldman reflects on a short documentary
            film she watched on a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2025. The film
            chronicles the experience of a young conscript who serves three
            years as an army photographer at a base in the Negev Desert,
            raising, in Goldman's words, "penetrating questions about universal
            concerns like generational trauma and why we perpetuate cycles of
            hatred and wars."

            David Runciman in conversation with Alexander Douglass, author of
            the recently published
            <cite>Against Identity: The Wisdom of Escaping the Self</cite>. Deep
            and nuanced, the discussion reveals how the ways in which we
            determine our identities have changed over the past several
            centuries. Where most of us were once born into pre-existing roles,
            and our task was largely to perform them, today many of us are
            expected to have an 'authentic', self-articulating identity—which we
            paradoxically construct, Douglass suggests, by emulating others.
