            A young man—a husband and father—undergoes surgery to remove a brain
            abscess, and, against all odds, survives. The piece reminded me of
            the impact Paul Kalanithi's <cite>When Breath Becomes Air</cite> had
            on me when I read it many years ago. There is something to reading
            about and contemplating death that centers you, slows you down, and
            gives you a perspective that is otherwise elusive in day-to-day
            life.

            A blow-by-blow account of Microsoft's 1986 IPO. Long on drama and

            endearingly dated, redolent of the 1980s.

            This piece really helped me better understand that voice in my head,
            the relentless narrator. It suggests that mind-body exercises (like
            meditation) and therapy can help you make peace with it, and getting
            absorbed in a task can help quiet it:
            <i
              >"Sometimes, this wandering is creative or soothing. But it also
              loops through self-referential themes – what others think of us,
              what went wrong, what might go wrong next. When overactive, it can
              drive anxiety and rumination. That's why people often report
              feeling happier when attention is less self-referential and fully
              immersed in the demands of a task. In those moments of flow,
              you're effortlessly absorbed in what you're doing and time seems
              to dissolve."</i
